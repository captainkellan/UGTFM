# Ultimate Guide to FREEMEDIA
###### Heck yeah.
###### DO NOT TRY TO PIRATE DISNEY MOVIES OR SHOWS. THEY WILL FIND YOU.
---
# Prerequisites
1. A debrid service like [All Debrid](https://alldebrid.com/) or Real-Debrid (This guide assumes you've chosen the superior ALL DEBRID)

> All Debrid offers a free trial. Once you start this trial or a subscription, a countdown timer begins and lasts 7 days (or 30 with subscription). DO NOT start your All Debrid account until you are ready to download something in order to get the best value out of it. You can still link the account to things without starting your trial time. You just won't be able to use it yet.

3. A downloader like [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/) (which is the only viable option)
4. A Reddit account (not required but helpful)
5. A Telegram account
6. A Google Drive account
7. If you want to stream without downloading or torrenting, a Firestick
8. An Android phone for mobile viewing. DO NOT buy an iPhone unless you plan on jailbreaking it.

# Getting Started [WINDOWS]
1. Download and install JDownloader. 
2. Connect JDownloader to your Debrid account. Create a rule in Account Manager that bans JD from using anything other than Debrid from downloading things. Also connect your Google Drive account and create a rule allowing it to be used (comes in handy for using private shared drives).
3. Install the JDownloader and All Debrid Chrome extensions
4. Get Telegram, join [Raymond Free Software](https://t.me/raymondfreesoftware) and their associated groups, then follow their steps to join the shared drives. These will be listed in the group's pinned message.

# Getting Started [KODI/FIRESTICK]
1. Download Kodi on your Firestick (THIS ALSO WORKS IF YOU USE MAC)
2. Install THE CREW addon and connect your AD account to it. 
# Finding stuff to download
###### ANY AND ALL digital media/software/whatever is FREE! Except Disney movies. 
1. Use the [r/Piracy megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread), [IgglyBuff's GitHub repo](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) or (my personal favorite) the [r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index). This is where a Reddit account comes in handy.
2. Search the shared drives you joined or ask in the Telegram channels. You can also search in Telegram which will typically find things faster, but they will be lower quality.
3. I will list some of my preferred sites at the bottom of this document. 

# How to download [WINDOWS]
1. Open JDownloader 
2. Go to Google Chrome and find the content you want to download (I STRONGLY RECOMMEND STICKING TO DDL SITES INSTEAD OF TORRENTING. TORRENTING EXPOSES YOUR IP TO ANTI-PIRACY FIRMS AND THEY WILL SUE YOU). 
3. Find the download link and get to the page that advertises a "premium" download speed. All Debrid bypasses this. 
4. Sometimes, All Debrid's Chrome extension will light up and offer to send the file to JD automatically. If it doesn't, open a new tab and go to the All Debrid website. 
5. Click "Downloader" and paste your link.
6. AD will generate a premium link. Get this into JDownloader via your preferred method (you should have been asked this when you first launched JDownloader). 
7. Let JDownloader do its magic.

# Dealing with split archives
>Every once in a while, you will come across a download that is split into multiple parts. Make sure you have the most updated version of 7Zip installed, then double click on the first part. 7Zip should be able to parse the files and extract them without much hassle.

# How to stream [KODI/FIRESTICK]
1. Install Kodi on your Firestick by following [this guide](https://troypoint.com/how-to-install-kodi-on-fire-tv/).
1. Install THE CREW addon by following [the Troypoint guide](https://troypoint.com/crew-kodi-addon/). The guide will also show you how to link your All Debrid account to Kodi.
2. Find the content you want to watch and wait for AD to load stream links (It will automatically take you to a list in a few seconds. Just wait for it).
3. This list will look overwhelming. Just pick anything in your preferred quality (you might have to click around before landing on a working or decent quality stream). 
> If a dialogue appears saying that the torrent is being downloaded, cancel. This just means that the stream you clicked isn't preloaded into All Debrid and will need to be uploaded first. This isn't a problem but it will take awhile and most content already has a preloaded stream.

4. Enjoy.
